# tensorpack
Neural Network Toolbox on TensorFlow

In development but usable. API might change a bit.

See some interesting [examples](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples) to learn.

## Features:

Focused on modularity:

+ Models has scoped abstraction of common models.
+ Dataflow defines data preprocessing in pure Python.
+ Callbacks systems controls training behavior.
