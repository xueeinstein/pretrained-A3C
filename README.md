# tensorpack
Neural Network Toolbox on TensorFlow

In development but usable. API might change a bit.

See some interesting [examples](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples) to learn about the framework:

+ [Double-DQN for playing Atari games](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/Atari2600)
+ [ResNet for Cifar10 classification](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/ResNet)
+ [char-rnn language model](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/char-rnn)

## Features:

Focused on modularity:

+ Models has scoped abstraction of common models.
+ Dataflow defines data preprocessing in pure Python.
+ Callbacks systems controls training behavior.
