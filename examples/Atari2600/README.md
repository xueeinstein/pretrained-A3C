Implement DQN in:

**Human-level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning**

and Double-DQN in:

**Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning**

To run:
```
./DQN.py --rom breakout.rom --gpu 0
```

Can reproduce the claimed performance, on games I've tested with (curves will be available soon).
A demo trained with Double-DQN on breakout is available at [youtube](https://youtu.be/o21mddZtE5Y).
